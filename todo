implement struct getters in order to preserve invariants

model.rs: support currencies other than USD
- ideal: every lot can have it's own currency

either restrict to a single currency for now, or implement support for Portfolios with multiple currencies,
 or gracefully handle otherwise
 - e.g. portools-streams currently assumes all lots have the same currency

 portools-stream: asset class
- mappings from symbol to asset class should not be hard-coded
- allow a symbol to map to multiple asset classes.  i.e. a percentage of each symbol could be represented
  by a different asset class

implement timeouts / cancellation
https://docs.rs/mongodb/2.4.0/mongodb/#warning-about-timeouts--cancellation

apply reasonable, configurable limits to the Lot values
// e.g. date shouldn't be in the ancient past
//      quantity shouldn't be absurdly high
//      cost_basis shouldn't be absurdly high
//      (quantity * cost_basis) shouldn't be absurdly high
//      total portfolio value shouldn't be absurdly high
//      total number of accounts shouldn't be absurdly high
