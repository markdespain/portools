mongo.rs:: put_lots should have upsert semantics instead of insert semantics
mongo.rs:: create_lots_index() should return an error instead of calling expect (panicking)
mongo.rs:: see if data types of some inserted fields can be changed to be numeric
mongo.rs:: don't create the index on application startup

main.rs:: allow Mongo URI to be configurable; make sure that cargo at Docker workflows work

csv_digester.rs: apply reasonable, configurable limits to the Lot values
// e.g. date shouldn't be in the ancient past
//      quantity shouldn't be absurdly high
//      cost_basis shouldn't be absurdly high
//      (quantity * cost_basis) shouldn't be absurdly high
//      total portfolio value shouldn't be absurdly high

main.rs: allow AppLimits to be configurable

container: get k8s (preferred) or Docker Compose workflow going

model.rs: support currencies other than USD
- ideal: every lot can have it's own currency

local.rs: address "never used" warning by either writing tests that use it or indicate that it is for testing
local.rs: replace MutexDao with read/wrote lock or some lock-free structure
