https://docs.rs/mongodb/2.4.0/mongodb/#warning-about-timeouts--cancellation

apply reasonable, configurable limits to the Lot values
// e.g. date shouldn't be in the ancient past
//      quantity shouldn't be absurdly high
//      cost_basis shouldn't be absurdly high
//      (quantity * cost_basis) shouldn't be absurdly high
//      total portfolio value shouldn't be absurdly high
//      total number of accounts shouldn't be absurdly high

mongo.rs:: create the index outside of application startup
create Docker Swarm / Kubernetes (minikube) workflow ... Dev containers
